/**
   * Server-side request interceptor.
   * <p>
   * A request Interceptor is designed to intercept the flow of a 
   * request/reply sequence through the ORB at specific points so that 
   * services can query the request information and manipulate the service 
   * contexts which are propagated between clients and servers. The primary 
   * use of request Interceptors is to enable ORB services to transfer 
   * context information between clients and servers. There are two types 
   * of request Interceptors: client-side and server-side. 
   * <p>
   * To write a server-side Interceptor, implement the 
   * ServerRequestInterceptor interface.
   *
